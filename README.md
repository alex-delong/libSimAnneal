# libSimAnneal
This library provides a functor class that can perform 1D simulated annealing, given a set of annealing parameters in the constructor.

Once constructed, the () operator will return the value of the independent variable that minimizes the energy. The show_plot() method will provide a graph of the independent variable vs. iteration count. 

# Dependencies
matplotplusplus is required for plotting functionality.
